        <h1>Rebozology is a gift from Mexico to the world of motherhood.</h1>
    <div class="imgFrame"> <img src="images/shawl_scarf.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <p>
            It was founded by a Mexican woman who gave birth in Denmark and who experienced the
            benefits of the traditional rebozo techniques during pregnancy, labor and the postpartum period.
            She also continued the use of rebozo as a baby carrier and enjoyed all the benefits from it. She
            decided to make this tool available for every mother and birth professional around the world and
            at the same time to support local indigenous communities in Mexico where rebozos are
            produced. </p>
            <p>
            She is married to a Dane and has lived in Copenhagen since 2012. They have two beautiful and
            sweet kids born in 2014 and 2017. She loves photography and travelling.</p>
            <p>
