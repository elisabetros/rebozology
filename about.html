                <h2>Meet Adriana</h2>

            <p>
                Rebozology was founded by Adriana, a Mexican woman who gave birth in Denmark and who experienced the
                benefits of the traditional rebozo techniques during pregnancy, labor and the postpartum period.
            </p>
               
               <p> Adriana also continued the use of rebozo as a baby carrier and enjoyed all the benefits from it. Adriana 
                decided to make this tool available for every mother and birth professional around the world and
                at the same time to support local indigenous communities in Mexico where rebozos are
                produced. </p>
            <p>
                Adriana is married to a Dane and has lived in Copenhagen since 2012. They have two beautiful and
                sweet kids born in 2014 and 2017. She loves photography and travelling.</p>
