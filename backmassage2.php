        <h2>What's the Effect:</h2>

        <h2>Tips and Considerations:</h2>
       <p>- The pregnant woman should sit on the edge of the chair, so she has space to lean back, with the rebozo covering her buttocks and lower back.</p>
       <p>- If the mom leans back slightly apart, she must feel that she is supported on all sides by the rebozo.</p>
       <p>- Make sure it is evenly distributed so that you have equal amounts of cloth to hold onto.</p>
       <p>- Make sure that the rebozo is taut and that your arms are straight.</p>
       <p>- The mom should experience that you are not pulling hard.</p>
       <p>- It helps the pregnant woman with Braxton- Hicks contractions or during labor, as a result of the relaxation of the belly muscles.</p>
       <p>- Try to smoothly move the rebozo from one side to the other side, increasing in intensity as the woman desires.</p>
