        <h1>Where do our rebozos come from?</h1>

       <h3 class="first">Our rebozos come from local indigenous communities in Mexico. </h3> 
       <p class="first">       The aim is to provide Mexican artisans with a fair way to export their products internationally.
            By doing so, we get in touch with the direct producers, get to know their family, home and years
             of experience and ensure that they get fairly compensated for their amazing creations. </p>
     <div class="imgFrame">
            <img src="images/rebozo_many.jpg" alt="">
     </div>  
      <div>
         <p>Behind every rebozo that we sell there is a person, a pair of hands and a story to be told. 
        When we look at a rebozo, the procedures and techniques that were used are not usually observed,
         the cost of the materials, the time and energy invested, the maintenance of the entire workforce. </p>

        <p>There are important differences in the type of work and effort put in each rebozo, the weaves in 
        waist loom and the fabrics in pedal loom. For example, producers that use a pedal loom can produce 
        up to 27 rebozos within a single laying in a period of one week; while the weaves in waist loom take
         up to one month per piece. </p>
      
        <p>Depending on the technique, it is necessary to go from the design to the actual rebozo, the threads
         need to be dyed, the knots untied, and it is necessary to knit and knot the ends: a total of 17
          steps to follow. In addition, the productive chain of specialization according to each step can 
          involve up to nine hands to achieve the rapacejo (area on each side of the rebozo).</p>
          <h3> When you buy products from Rebozology, you help all these communities to keep alive their
                traditions and to be able to support their families. </h3>
