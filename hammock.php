        <h2>Tips and Considerations:</h2>
    <p>- The pregnant woman should position herself on her elbows and knees, or if it’s more comfortable, she could use a birthing ball or a sofa for support.</p>    
    <p>- Her knees must be far apart allowing as much room as possible for the belly which should hang free.</p>    
    <p>- Standing behind the woman, you should center the rebozo under the belly, holding both its ends, so the belly is hanging in the rebozo like a hammock.</p>    
    <p>- Make sure the rebozo is not tight on the belly, moving it gently from side to side.

- Continue to monitor the needs of the pregnant woman.</p>    
    <p>- You can also pull the belly upwards, holding it in this position for a few seconds, to relieve the pregnant woman of the weight of the belly.</p>    
    <p>- We recommend that if you are using a birthing ball, place a rebozo or a soft towel on the surface, to provide a more comforting smell and contact.</p>
