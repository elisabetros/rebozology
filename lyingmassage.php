        <h2>Tips and Considerations:</h2>
        <p>- The mom lies on her back, it will be nice if she is not direct to the floor as it can be cold. The head can be resting on a pillow.</p>

                <p>- The legs can be extended on the floor, she can have a pillow below her knees or she can bend the knees.
                </p>
                <p>- It is important to place your feet as close to the woman as possible, so you can have a better balance and it’s not so hard for you.
                </p>
                <p>- Place the rebozo under the buttocks of the mom. Make sure the rebozo covers the entire pelvic area extending to her waist to below the buttocks.
                </p>
                <p>- The center of the rebozo is below the tailbone of the woman.
                </p>
                <p>- Wrap the rebozo around your wrists, so you can get a good grip.
                </p>
                <p>- The firm grip is needed when you are lifting the woman up a little bit.
                </p>
                <p>- Grasp the end of the rebozo, bend your knees a little bit and be sure your back is straight.
                </p>
                <p>- Move the rebozo from one side to the other side.
                </p>
                <p>- Always ask the mom how intense she will like the movement, if slow and rolling or short and fast.</p>
