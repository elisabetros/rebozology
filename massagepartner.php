        <h2>Tips and Considerations:</h2>
        <p>- The woman sits down on the floor on top of a mat or a sheet.</p>
        <p>- Fold the rebozo in the middle and place it around the woman’s waist up to the upper back below the arms.</p>
        <p>- The doula or midwife hold the rebozo around her wrists, with straight arms.</p>
        <p>- Pushing efforts are more effective if the mother can hold on to something, by pulling of a rebozo, she feels her sense of power and can focus on the relaxation of the pelvic floor.</p>
        <p>- She pushes and release the rebozo in coordination of her contractions.</p>
        <p>- The partner can give support by doing a massage in the shoulders. It is up to the woman if she prefers her partner to be supportive during or in between contractions.</p>
        <p>- In between contractions the woman can go back to her knees while the partner can press the lower back for relaxing.</p>
        <p>- If the woman feels more comfortable, she can go to the squat position while pushing, leaning the arms in her partner’s upper legs, using them as support.</p>
