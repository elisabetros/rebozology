        <h2>Tips and Considerations:</h2>
    <p>- The pregnant women should stand with her feet slightly apart. To avoid slipping, the removal of socks and shoes is preferable.</p>    
    <p>- Place the rebozo around the hips, from the waist to the upper part of the thighs, in order to cover the whole pelvic area.</p>    
    <p>- The rebozo should be centered on the woman’s tailbone, so that there is an equal amount of cloth to hold onto on each side.</p>    
    <p>- Grasp both ends of the rebozo and ensure a firm grip by wrapping them around the wrists.</p>    
    <p>- Start with a relaxed rhythm, pulling from one side of the cloth to the other. You should be moving in the same way as the pregnant woman, ensuring that she is not taking the lead and moving the rebozo herself.</p>    
    <p>- It can be short or large movements, depending on the pregnant woman’s preferences.</p>    
    <h3>Waist Massage</h3>   
    <p>- The pregnant woman stands, as described above, or sitting down with the rebozo is folded in half and placed around her waist.</p>    
    <p>- Check if the woman prefers to place her arms inside the rebozo. Leaving her arms outside will give her more movement in the shoulders.</p>
