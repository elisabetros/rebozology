                <h2 class="greenBG">Meet Adriana</h2>

            <p> Rebozology was founded by Adriana, a Mexican woman who gave birth in Denmark and who experienced the benefits of the 
                traditional rebozo techniques during pregnancy, labor and the postpartum period.  </p>
               
               <p>  Adriana also continued the use of rebozo as a baby carrier and enjoyed all its benefits. 
                    She decided to make this tool available for every mother and birth professional around the world
                     and at the same time to support local indigenous communities in Mexico where rebozos are produced. ðŸ™Œâœ¨ Â </p>
            <p> Adriana is married to Christian, a Dane, they have been living in Copenhagen since 2012. They have two beautiful and
                sweet kids born in 2014 and 2017. She loves photography and travelling.</p>
